# ExtRS for custom SSRS Auth
This assembly extends the Microsoft Custom Security Sample to allow for a pass-thru of the Login page if something present in the HttpRequest verifies that user is already authenticated. For instance, the user already has an app token or are on the intranet- any type of custom authentication and level of authorization is possible.

Replace **[your_sym_encr_key]** with your symetric encryption key. Clients can encrypt SSRS URL access querystring with Sonrai.ExtRSAuth.Excryption.Encrypt() or a similiar 128-bit AES encryption implementation, or modify Encrypt() with any encryption algorythm and size that meets your requirements.

To modify the source in order for the auth to meet your specific needs, the open source project is here: https://github.com/cfitzg/ExtRSAuth-open-src
